# Condorcet

This is the Git repo for the Condorcet library, which attempts to provide safe and easy methods for calculating elections in Rust. This repo contains two crates: ``condorcet`` and ``condorcet_primitives``. ``condorcet_primitives`` is for those who just want the functions to calculate different voting methods. ``condorcet`` takes those functions and wraps them in an easy-to-use API.
